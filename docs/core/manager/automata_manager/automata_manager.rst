AutomataManager
===============

``AutomataManager`` is a class for managing the execution of the
Automata system. It contains a ``main_agent`` and a ``coordinator``
which work together during the execution.

Overview
--------

``AutomataManager`` provides an interface for managing the agents and
coordinating their operations in the Automata system. The class
initializes with a ``main_agent`` and a ``coordinator``, and it contains
a ``run`` method which executes the systemâ€™s logic.

-  ``automata.core.agent.automata_agent.AutomataAgent``
-  ``automata.core.coordinator.automata_coordinator.AutomataCoordinator``
-  ``automata.core.tasks.task.AutomataTask``

Usage Example
-------------

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.manager.automata_manager import AutomataManager
   from automata.core.agent.automata_agent import AutomataAgent
   from automata.core.coordinator.automata_coordinator import AutomataCoordinator

   main_agent = AutomataAgent("Example instruction.")
   coordinator = AutomataCoordinator()

   manager = AutomataManager(main_agent, coordinator)
   manager.run()

Limitations
-----------

The ``AutomataManager`` class has a few limitations. In its current
implementation, it directly manages ``main_agent`` and ``coordinator``,
making it tightly coupled with the setup. Furthermore, the functionality
provided by the ``run`` method is limited, as it only delegates the
execution to the ``main_agent``.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can the ``AutomataManager`` be redesigned to support a more flexible
   setup, such as working with different agent and coordinator
   implementations?
-  How can the functionality of the ``run`` method be extended to show
   more details and better manage the system execution?
