SymbolReference
===============

``SymbolReference`` is a class representing a reference to a symbol in
the codebase. It is primarily used in the context of finding and
tracking references to code symbols, such as classes, methods, or local
variables. The class provides methods for comparing symbol references
and generating hash values for quick reference lookup.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create some
``SymbolReference`` objects and compare them using the ``__eq__()`` and
``__hash__()`` methods.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.search.symbol_types import SymbolReference, Symbol

   # Creating some sample Symbol objects
   symbol1 = Symbol(uri="symbol1-uri")
   symbol2 = Symbol(uri="symbol2-uri")

   # Creating SymbolReference objects with the sample Symbols
   ref1 = SymbolReference(symbol1, 1, 1)
   ref2 = SymbolReference(symbol1, 1, 1)
   ref3 = SymbolReference(symbol2, 1, 2)

   print(ref1 == ref2)  # Should output: True
   print(ref1 == ref3)  # Should output: False

   print(hash(ref1))  # Example output: 304114106338418492

Limitations
-----------

The ``__hash__()`` method of the ``SymbolReference`` class may cause
hash collisions if the same symbol is referenced in different files at
the same location (same line number and column number). This is because
the hash is generated based on the symbol’s URI, line number, and column
number. The likelihood of such collisions is relatively low, but it’s
still important to consider when using this class.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there potential optimizations or enhancements to the
   ``__hash__()`` method to reduce the likelihood of hash collisions?
