Overview
--------

``SymbolFactory`` is an abstract base class for creating and
initializing Symbol-related objects. This class provides a template
method called ``create``, which should be implemented by the subclasses.
The primary purpose of subclasses of ``SymbolFactory`` is to create
Symbols following the standardized string representation given in the
context of ``automata.core.search.symbol_types.Symbol``.

Example
-------

As ``SymbolFactory`` is an abstract base class, it cannot be directly
used for instantiation. Instead, the custom implementation of the
``SymbolFactory`` class should be created by implementing the ``create``
method.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.search.symbol_factory import SymbolFactory
   from automata.core.search.symbol_types import Symbol

   class CustomSymbolFactory(SymbolFactory):
       def create(self, *args, **kwargs):
           # Custom implementation details for creating Symbol objects
           pass

   custom_factory = CustomSymbolFactory()
   symbol = custom_factory.create(*args, **kwargs)

Limitations
-----------

The main limitation of ``SymbolFactory`` is that it is only an abstract
base class and does not provide any actual implementation details. The
users of this class must provide their custom implementations to create
and initialize Symbol-related objects.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What are some concrete implementations of ``SymbolFactory`` in the
   codebase?
