SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory
=========================

``SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory`` is a factory class for creating instances
of ``SymbolEmbeddingMap``. This class is used for creating
``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` objects by simply calling the ``create`` method
with variable arguments and keyword arguments.

Overview
--------

``SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory`` provides an easy way to create
``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` objects without explicitly importing and calling
``SymbolEmbeddingMap``. This can be helpful in cases where you want to
create ``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` objects dynamically based on certain
conditions or parameters.

-  ``automata.core.search.symbol_factory.SymbolSimilarityFactory``

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of
``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` using ``SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory``.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.search.symbol_factory import SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory

   # Define the required arguments for creating a SymbolEmbeddingMap
   all_defined_symbols = [...]  # List of symbols (e.g., classes, methods)

   # Create the SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory
   factory = SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory()

   # Create a SymbolEmbeddingMap using the factory
   symbol_embedding_map = factory.create(all_defined_symbols=all_defined_symbols, build_new_embedding_map=True)

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory`` is limited by the fact that it only
simplifies the creation of ``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` instances. It does not
offer additional functionality beyond what is already available in the
``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` class.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there other use cases where ``SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory`` could
   provide benefits beyond just simplifying the creation of
   ``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` instances?
-  The role of the ``SymbolEmbeddingMapFactory`` class seems quite
   limited. Are there any plans to extend its functionality in the
   future?
