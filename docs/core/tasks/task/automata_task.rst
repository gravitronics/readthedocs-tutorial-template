AutomataTask
============

``AutomataTask`` is a specialized task class designed to be executed by
the TaskExecutor. It is responsible for managing and executing an
AutomataAgent with provided instructions, managing logs, and
representing task attributes.

Overview
--------

``AutomataTask`` extends the base task class to include initialization,
validation, and special methods for managing agent and helper agent
instances, logging, and converting the task data to a JSON format. In
addition to managing the AutomataAgent itself, it also handles logging
for the task, storing logs in a designated location.

-  ``automata.core.agent.automata_agent.AutomataAgent``

Example
-------

Here is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of
``AutomataTask`` and work with its various methods.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.tasks.task import AutomataTask
   from automata.configs.config_enums import AgentConfigName
   from automata.repository_manager import RepositoryManager

   repo_manager = RepositoryManager()
   task = AutomataTask(
       repo_manager,
       main_config_name=AgentConfigName.TEST.value,
       instructions="This is a test."
   )
   task_result = task.run()

Limitations
-----------

``AutomataTask`` is specifically designed to work with the AutomataAgent
and its associated classes, which means it cannot work with other agent
types or non-automata related tasks. Additionally, it has limited error
handling capabilities and relies on proper agent configuration during
initialization.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can ``AutomataTask`` be extended or adapted to work with other agent
   types or non-automata related tasks?

-  How can error handling capabilities be improved within the
   ``AutomataTask`` class?
