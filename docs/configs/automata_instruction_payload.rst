AutomataInstructionPayload
==========================

``AutomataInstructionPayload`` is a class used to store the payload for
formatting the introduction instruction. Fields on this class are used
to format the introduction instruction. It provides a method (i.e.,
``validate_fields``) to validate the required fields, ensuring that they
are initialized. The class is closely related to
``AutomataAgentConfig``, which includes the
``AutomataInstructionPayload`` as one of its attributes.

Overview
--------

``AutomataInstructionPayload`` contains the following fields: -
``agents_message``: A message from the agent to be included in the
introduction instruction. - ``overview``: A summary or overview of the
task or the information to be included in the introduction instruction.
- ``tools``: A description of tools used by the agent during task
execution.

The class maintains a method to validate the required fields in its
instance, ensuring their initialization is correct.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``AutomataInstructionPayload`` and validate its fields.

.. code:: python

   from automata.configs.automata_agent_configs import AutomataInstructionPayload

   agents_message = "This is a message from the agent."
   overview = "This is a summary of the task."
   tools = "These are the tools used by the agent."

   instruction_payload = AutomataInstructionPayload(agents_message=agents_message, overview=overview, tools=tools)

   required_fields = ["agents_message", "overview", "tools"]
   instruction_payload.validate_fields(required_fields)

Limitations
-----------

One of the limitations of ``AutomataInstructionPayload`` is that it only
checks for the initialization of the required fields and not their
validity. Further validation of the contents of the fields would be
necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated
introduction instructions.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we best extend the validation provided by ``validate_fields``
   to include the verification of field contents?
