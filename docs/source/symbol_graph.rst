SymbolGraph
===========

``SymbolGraph`` is a class that represents a graph of symbols and their
relationships, such as dependencies and references. A symbol in this
context is like a URI that identifies a class, method, or a local
variable in code. ``SymbolGraph`` allows users to analyze and search for
symbols in a structured manner. It is closely related to other classes
such as ``Symbol``, ``CodePrinter``, and ``GraphBuilder``. The class
provides methods to retrieve all defined symbols, retrieve the
dependencies and relationships of a given symbol, and get references to
a symbol in the graph.

Overview
--------

``SymbolGraph`` provides methods to search for symbols within a graph,
retrieve their relationships, and analyze the overall structure
containing the symbols. It can be initialized with an index protobuf
file path and creates a graph of symbols and their relationships based
on the provided index data. The graph is created using a
``GraphBuilder`` instance, and a ``_SymbolGraphNavigator`` instance is
used for navigation.

-  ``automata.core.code_indexing.python_code_printer.CodePrinter``
-  ``automata.core.search.symbol_graph.GraphBuilder``

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of
``SymbolGraph`` using a valid index protobuf file path.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.search.symbol_graph import SymbolGraph

   index_path = "/path/to/index.protobuf"
   symbol_graph = SymbolGraph(index_path)

Limitations
-----------

The main limitation of the ``SymbolGraph`` is that it requires a valid
index protobuf file to create a meaningful graph of symbols. The file
path must be accessible and contain valid index data to initialize the
graph correctly. When dealing with test cases and mock objects, it might
be difficult to provide appropriate index data or paths, which could
affect the accuracy and usability of the class.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we improve the initialization of the ``SymbolGraph`` class to
   handle cases where index data is not readily available?
-  Is there a more efficient way to represent the relationships between
   symbols in the graph?
