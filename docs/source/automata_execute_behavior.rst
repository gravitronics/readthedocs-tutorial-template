AutomataExecuteBehavior
=======================

``AutomataExecuteBehavior`` is a class for executing general tasks in
the Automata framework. It is responsible for handling the execution
process of ``AutomataTask`` instances, managing the task status and
updating results or errors if encountered during task execution.

Overview
--------

``AutomataExecuteBehavior`` is a part of the task execution process in
the Automata framework. It serves as the core executor for general
tasks, which includes running tasks, managing task statuses, and
handling exceptions. The main method, ``execute``, runs the task,
updates its status, and reports any encountered errors. This class is
generally used in conjunction with a ``TaskExecutor`` and an
``AutomataTask``.

-  ``automata.core.tasks.automata_task_executor.IExecuteBehavior``

Example
-------

The following example showcases the use of ``AutomataExecuteBehavior``
with a ``TaskExecutor`` and an ``AutomataTask`` instance.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.tasks.automata_task_executor import AutomataExecuteBehavior, TaskExecutor
   from automata.core.tasks.task import AutomataTask

   # Define a sample task
   class MyAutomataTask(AutomataTask):
       def run(self):
           return "Task completed successfully"

   task = MyAutomataTask()

   execute_behavior = AutomataExecuteBehavior()
   task_executor = TaskExecutor(execute_behavior)
   task_executor.execute(task)

   print(task.status)  # Should output TaskStatus.SUCCESS
   print(task.result)  # Should output "Task completed successfully"

Limitations
-----------

``AutomataExecuteBehavior`` is limited to general task execution
scenarios and does not support different types of tasks or customized
behaviors. For more specific task execution behaviors, custom
implementations of ``IExecuteBehavior`` should be created.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can ``AutomataExecuteBehavior`` be extended to handle custom task
   execution scenarios?
