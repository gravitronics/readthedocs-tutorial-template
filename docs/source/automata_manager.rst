AutomataManager
===============

``AutomataManager`` is a class for managing the execution of the
Automata system. It is responsible for initializing and running an
``AutomataAgent`` along with an ``AutomataCoordinator``. The ``run``
method is responsible for the system execution logic and returns the
result of the agentâ€™s ``run()`` method.

Overview
--------

The primary purpose of the ``AutomataManager`` is to provide a unified
interface for managing the execution of multiple instances of an
``AutomataAgent`` and coordinating their activities using an
``AutomataCoordinator``. It simplifies the process of setting up and
managing an Automata system.

-  ``automata.core.coordinator.automata_coordinator.AutomataCoordinator``
-  ``automata.core.tasks.task.AutomataTask``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create and run an instance of
the ``AutomataManager``.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.automata_agent import AutomataAgent
   from automata.core.coordinator.automata_coordinator import AutomataCoordinator
   from automata.core.manager.automata_manager import AutomataManager

   main_agent = AutomataAgent('Sample Instruction')
   coordinator = AutomataCoordinator()

   # Create instance of AutomataManager
   manager = AutomataManager(main_agent, coordinator)

   # Run the AutomataManager
   result = manager.run()
   print("Result:", result)

Limitations
-----------

``AutomataManager`` requires instances of ``AutomataAgent`` and
``AutomataCoordinator`` to be initialized before creating the manager
instance. It does not provide a way to manage the creation and setup of
these instances itself. Moreover, it currently does not provide a way to
setup and manage multiple agents running concurrently within the same
manager.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can the AutomataManager be enhanced to manage the creation and setup
   of ``AutomataAgent`` and ``AutomataCoordinator`` instances?
-  How can we improve the support for managing multiple agents running
   concurrently within an AutomataManager?
