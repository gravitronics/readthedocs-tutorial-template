SymbolSearcher
==============

``SymbolSearcher`` is a class that provides a comprehensive search
functionality across the indexed codebase. It includes a range of search
options such as symbol references, symbol rank, exact search, and source
code retrieval. The class integrates with other components like
``SymbolGraph``, ``SymbolEmbeddingMap``, ``SymbolSimilarity``, and
``SymbolRank``.

Overview
--------

``SymbolSearcher`` offers several search methods to query different
types of information from the indexed codebase based on the context
provided. With the help of its instance variables and associated
classes, ``SymbolSearcher`` is able to perform complex searches and
return relevant results. The class uses methods such as
``exact_search``, ``process_query``, ``retrieve_source_code_by_symbol``,
``symbol_rank_search``, and ``symbol_references`` to perform these
search operations.

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of
``SymbolSearcher`` and use it to perform a symbol rank search.

.. code:: python

   from automata.tools.search.symbol_searcher import SymbolSearcher
   from automata.core.search.symbol_graph import SymbolGraph
   from automata.core.search.symbol_rank.symbol_embedding_map import SymbolEmbeddingMap
   from automata.core.search.symbol_rank.symbol_similarity import SymbolSimilarity
   from automata.core.search.symbol_rank.symbol_rank import SymbolRankConfig

   symbol_graph = SymbolGraph()
   symbol_embedding_map = SymbolEmbeddingMap()
   symbol_similarity = SymbolSimilarity()
   symbol_rank_config = SymbolRankConfig()

   symbol_searcher = SymbolSearcher(
       symbol_graph, symbol_embedding_map, symbol_similarity, symbol_rank_config
   )

   query = "type:symbol_rank query:keyword"
   results = symbol_searcher.process_query(query)
   print(results)

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolSearcher`` is that it depends on the
quality and accuracy of its associated components like ``SymbolGraph``,
``SymbolEmbeddingMap``, and ``SymbolSimilarity``. Moreover, given the
complexity of the codebase and the dependencies involved, it expects a
certain level of compliance and standardization in the code structure
and its representations.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any optimizations that could be applied to the
   ``SymbolSearcher`` class to improve its performance and accuracy?

-  How does the ``SymbolSearcher`` handle cases where there are
   multiple, conflicting search results from different components?
