AutomataAgent
=============

``AutomataAgent`` is an autonomous agent designed to execute
instructions and report the results back to the main system. The agent
communicates with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on given
instructions and manages interactions with various tools.

Overview
--------

``AutomataAgent`` is responsible for executing a sequence of tasks until
a result is produced or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
The agent can include various tools and receive instructions specified
by its configurations. It can communicate with an
``AutomataCoordinator`` and supports setup, iteration, and error
handling for the task execution process.

-  ``automata.core.tasks.task.AutomataTask``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of an
``AutomataAgent``.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.automata_agent import AutomataAgent
   from automata.configs.automata_agent_configs import AutomataAgentConfig
   from automata.configs.config_enums import AgentConfigName

   config_name = AgentConfigName.AUTOMATA_MAIN_DEV
   config = AutomataAgentConfig.load(config_name)
   instructions = "Your instructions here."

   agent = AutomataAgent(instructions, config)

Limitations
-----------

The ``AutomataAgent`` has some limitations that stem from its reliance
on the OpenAI API. The quality and accuracy of the generated responses
can vary. Additionally, the agent may not be able to complete tasks or
produce accurate results when the maximum number of iterations is
exceeded or if interrupted midway through a task execution.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there alternative methods to generate responses other than using
   the OpenAI API?
-  How can we provide custom tools or additional configurations for the
   agent during runtime?
