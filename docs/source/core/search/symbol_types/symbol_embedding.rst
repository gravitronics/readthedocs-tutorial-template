Automata Core Search Symbol Types: SymbolEmbedding
--------------------------------------------------

``SymbolEmbedding`` is a utility class within the Automata core search
library that represents the embedding of a specific symbol. It consists
of the symbol itself, an associated vector representation (embedding),
and the source code of the symbol. SymbolEmbeddings are used in
conjunction with other classes like ``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` and
``SymbolSimilarity`` to search, rank, and compare symbols based on their
embeddings.

Overview
--------

``SymbolEmbedding`` is a lightweight container class for holding a
symbol, its vector representation, and the source code. It is mainly
used in the searching and ranking of symbols within the Automata core
search library. SymbolEmbeddings are created within the
``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` class and then used by the ``SymbolSimilarity``
class for calculating similarities between symbols.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create a ``SymbolEmbedding``
instance for a given symbol and its associated vector representation
(embedding).

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.search.symbol_types import SymbolEmbedding, Symbol
   import numpy as np

   symbol = Symbol.parse("scip-python python automata GUID `automata.core.example`/ExampleClass#")
   vector = np.array([0.4, 0.6, 0.8], dtype=np.float32)
   source_code = "class ExampleClass: pass"

   symbol_embedding = SymbolEmbedding(symbol=symbol, vector=vector, source_code=source_code)

Limitations
-----------

Given the simplicity of the ``SymbolEmbedding`` class, there are no
critical limitations to be concerned about. However, it should be
remembered that ``SymbolEmbedding`` objects are generally not used
directly but rather as part of larger processes in classes like
``SymbolEmbeddingMap`` and ``SymbolSimilarity``. Also, embedding
generation is not performed within this class; it relies on external
utilities or classes to provide the actual embeddings.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there specific use cases where SymbolEmbedding is used directly
   and not within the context of SymbolEmbeddingMap or SymbolSimilarity?
-  Are the embeddings encoded in a specific format, or can they be of
   any dimensional structure?
