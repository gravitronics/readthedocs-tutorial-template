AutomataAgent
=============

``AutomataAgent`` is an autonomous agent designed to execute
instructions and interact with various tools. It communicates with the
OpenAI API to generate responses based on given instructions and manages
interactions with various tools. The agent is used in conjunction with
the ``AutomataAgentConfig`` class to load and manage its configuration.

Overview
--------

The ``AutomataAgent`` class provides methods to initialize the agent,
execute a single iteration of a task, run the agent until a result is
produced or the maximum iterations are exceeded, and set the coordinator
for the main agent. Additionally, the class sets up the agent by
initializing the database and loading the configuration. This module
contains the main class and closely related symbols for working with
AutomataAgent instances.

-  ``automata.configs.automata_agent_configs.AutomataAgentConfig``
-  ``automata.core.coordinator.automata_coordinator.AutomataCoordinator``

-  ``automata.configs.automata_agent_config_utils.AutomataAgentConfigBuilder``

Example
-------

In this example, we create an ``AutomataAgent`` instance with a given
set of instructions and a configuration object.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.automata_agent import AutomataAgent
   from automata.configs.automata_agent_configs import AutomataAgentConfig

   instructions = "Some instructions for the agent."
   config = AutomataAgentConfig.load(AgentConfigName.AUTOMATA_MAIN_DEV)

   agent = AutomataAgent(instructions, config)

Now that we have an instance of ``AutomataAgent``, we can run the agent
to execute the instructions and produce a result.

.. code:: python

   result = agent.run()
   print("Result:", result)

Limitations
-----------

The ``AutomataAgent`` relies on the OpenAI API for generating responses,
therefore it’s restricted by the limitations of the API in terms of
response quality and consistency. Moreover, the agent’s capabilities
depend on the available tools and configurations provided at the time of
instantiation. Some complex instructions might cause the agent to fail
or produce unexpected results.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we improve the interaction between the ``AutomataAgent`` and
   the OpenAI API for better consistency and quality?
