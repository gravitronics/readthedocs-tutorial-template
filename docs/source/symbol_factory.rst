SymbolFactory
-------------

The ``SymbolFactory`` is an abstract class that provides a method to
create instances of ``Symbol``. It cannot be instantiated by itself, but
provides the base class for other classes that create instances of
``Symbol``.

The ``SymbolFactory`` comes with a single method, ``create()``, which is
not implemented in this abstract class and should be implemented in any
derived class according to the specific ``Symbol`` to be created.

.. code:: python

   class SymbolFactory:
       def create(self, *args, **kwargs):
           raise NotImplementedError

Example
-------

This example shows how a derived class, ``MySymbolFactory``, can be used
to create instances of a hypothetical ``MySymbol`` class:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.search.symbol_factory import SymbolFactory
   from my_symbol import MySymbol

   class MySymbolFactory(SymbolFactory):
       def create(self, *args, **kwargs):
           return MySymbol(*args, **kwargs)

   symbol_factory = MySymbolFactory()
   symbol = symbol_factory.create("arg1", some_kwarg="value")

Be sure to replace ``my_symbol`` with the actual module where your
custom symbol class is defined.

Limitations
-----------

As an abstract class, ``SymbolFactory`` itself does not provide any
functionality and cannot be instantiated. Developers need to create
derived classes by implementing the ``create`` method.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the purpose of ``SymbolFactory`` in the larger system?
-  How can we extend ``SymbolFactory`` to handle more complex scenarios?
